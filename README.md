# Upper Model Ontology for Maturity Model Design
This ontology provides a structured framework for designing and constructing maturity models across various domains, focusing on Industry 5.0 readiness. Based on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), it defines key concepts and relationships for the maturity management process, covering both the assessment and improvement phases. The upper model ontology ensures consistency, reduces ambiguity, and supports continuous improvement cycles by linking system indicators with best practices. Access the ontology through the [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariateresaphd/OntologyMaturityModel/main/ONTOLOGIA_UPPERMODEL_V2.rdf) to explore and customize it for your specific domain and needs.
